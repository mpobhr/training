# Introduction to web application development

## Development setup
* .NET 5.0 SDK:
    * [Download](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet/5.0)
    * `$ dotnet --version`
    
* Visual Studio Code:
    * [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download)
    * `$ code `

## NET 5.0
It is Microsoft Technology to improve experience creating application. Net 5.0 provide better type safety and memory management compare with low level programming language such as C/C++ and provide better analysis compare to scripting language like JS.
* Type Safety:
    * Prevent Stack overflow.
    * Avoid runtime crash.
    * Guard from possible system corruption.
* Memory Management:
    * manual managed.
    * automatic managed with GC.
* Analysis
    * Reduce possible runtime error.
    * Dead code elimination.
    * Warning and suggestion for better code.



.NET 5.0 consist of 
* Common Language Runtime (CLR)
    * OS Independent, Abstract common Process
    * Running CIL process
    * Handle type safety
    * Manage memory (GC)
    * Just in Time Compilation (optimize code)
    * Profile Guided Optimization (PGO)
* Common Intermediated Language (CIL)
    * Cross Platform instruction representation (improve ASM)
    * Multiple language support (C#, VB, F#)
* CoreFX

## Introduction to C# Programming Language 

## Introduction to Visual Studio Code
* Cross platform editor based on Electron
* uses for web development center around javascript
* Excellent C# Editor with Limited IDE capability

## Introduction to Git Source Control Management
* Decentralize Source Control Management
* Record code history and changes and involved files
* Allow multiple people work on same code
* Allow multiple version within same repository
* Better handling multiple version, with branching
* Init Repo, Staging, Commit, History, Remote, Push, Pull,Sync, Blame


## Introduction to Visual Studio 2019 (Community Edition)
* Full fledge IDE for better development experience
* Multiple Programming Language support
* Multiple Platform Support
* Command Line, Desktop, Mobile, Cloud, IoT

## Introduction to AspNetCore 5.0
* Cross platform C# Web Application Framework
